# 🍽️ AI-Based Food Recognition and Calorie Estimator

## 🌟 Overview

This project is an **AI-powered food recognition and calorie estimation system**. It utilizes deep learning models, particularly **CNNs and transfer learning**, to classify food items from images and estimate their calorie content based on nutritional data.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Food image classification using deep learning (CNN, transfer learning)
✅ Calorie estimation using a lookup algorithm from nutritional datasets
✅ Image preprocessing and augmentation for improved accuracy
✅ Web API for model inference and integration
✅ Deployment using Flask/FastAPI with Docker support

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Pillow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-k Accuracy (classification), MAE, RMSE, MSE, R² (calorie estimation)
- **Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI, Docker, Cloud Platforms (Heroku, AWS, GCP)
- **Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau, Bubble Chart, TensorBoard

## 🔧 Installation

### 💾 Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AI-Based-Food-Recognition-and-Calorie-Estimator/food-recognition-calorie-estimator.git
cd food-recognition-calorie-estimator
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

To ensure all dependencies are installed correctly, use the following command:

## 🏋️ Model Training

1️⃣ Preprocess the dataset (resizing, normalization, augmentation)\
2️⃣ Train the CNN model using transfer learning (ResNet, MobileNet, etc.)\
3️⃣ Fine-tune and evaluate performance on test data\
4️⃣ Save the trained model for inference

---

## 🌍 API Usage

The API accepts food images and returns:

- 📌 Predicted food category
- 📌 Estimated calorie value

💡 **Example API call using \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*****`curl`**:

```sh
curl -X POST -F "file=@food_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

🎯 Dockerize the application\
🎯 Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Heroku)\
🎯 Set up a frontend interface (optional)

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

✨ Support for multiple food items in a single image\
✨ Improved calorie estimation using portion size detection\
✨ Mobile application integration
